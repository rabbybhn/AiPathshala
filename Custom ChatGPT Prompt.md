Making of Agentic-AI That Can Do Anything


I just built an AI agent in less than 30 minutes without knowing how to code for completely free hi I'm is an and this is a crazy AI agent I've just built which goes on amazon.in logs into my account I gave it the password searches for a detergent selects a detergent it adds it to the cart and it then purchases it on my behalf using my Amazon pay balance selects the address and and makes the purchase!  That is insane!  This is the future of AI agents ! 

and by the end of this video you'll learn how to make an AI agent just like this for completely free without knowing a single thing about coding watch this till the end there's so much to learn and you can ask AI agents to do anything book flights for you you can ask AI agents to recommend you videos to watch on YouTube you can literally ask AI agent to do all the things that you do yourself done automatically for you so that it can save you the time and the money to do it 

let me show you how it works so to create an AI agent like this all you need to first of all do is to 

-install python on your system the technology 

we use today is called browseruse and the llm we use is up to your choice you can use deep seek R1 you can also use Gemini you can also use GPT 40 and ov1 models depends on what you want to do I'll show you how to do it for completely free using Gemini as well so browser use is what we'll be using this is a free open Source GitHub repository which will help you to create any AI agent that you want all right let's go down into the readme section of it and if

you are getting annoyed by looking at all the code, don't worry it's very simple and very straightforward. You don't even have to worry about anything, you can just select all the text on this website and go to chat. openai and just ask this how do I install browser use on Mac OS for example and just give it all of this data and it will tell you step by step how can you install

 browseruse package right so this is a very simple way to do it first you need to  install the latest version of python so you can go to python you can go to downloads and you can start downloading python on your own system and once you install python on your computer you can basically close this move it to bin and then basically just copy this command go to terminal and paste this I'll use pip 3 install browseruse and it is going to install the library of browser use on my system  so it'll take a couple of seconds to install that and now it is installed the next step is for us to install playwright so we'll just copy the same text paste it over here again you don't have to worry anything about the code just follow the instructions and just do the things step by step so we install 

Playwright and once playwright is downloaded the next step is to install webUI so basically with browseruse webUI is going to to help you interact with browser use with a nice interface so that's all that it really is about so now if you can go down you will see test with UI you can test browseruse with a UI repository so we'll just open this with a new link 

I'll make  a very simple folder on my desktop I'll just say new folder and I'll just call it let's say AI agent demo and all I have to do now is to open up my terminal and I can use LS to look at all the items in this directory I can do CD desktop and I can enter desktop and after that I just have to say CD AI agent and I'm inside the AI agent folder right now and now all I have to do is to say that I want to get clone and I'll put this link that I got from this particular repository so I can just go to code and I can just grab this link right here this link that you can see I'll just copy this I'll put this link over here and I want to install this repository in this particular folder so I'll just click on enter and it is now installed so now if you would go here if you would open AI agent you would have a web UI folder inside 

so we will again click on LS and we can just say CD web UI and now we are inside the web UI folder okay so now we we are pretty much done with setting this up if you go down and look at how to start using web UI it will say you have to first of all use UV what is UV I don't know we'll just click on it and see so UV is an extremely fast python package and project manager written in trust again 

you don't need to know what that is or how that works you basically just need to install it so I'll just grab this link or this command I'll put it in my terminal and I'll enter and now I have UV installed in my system yep it's good to go so this will help us create an environment right so we will now copy this First Command UV VNV python 3.11 again you don't need to know what that means just press enter okay it says UV not recognized I have to go to my a new terminal and I can just say CD desktop CD AI agent I can do CD the web UI and I can just now say UV and this Command right here and now what will happen is it will create a environment for you for me to run this project so now I have this environment activated it says activated with this particular command I'll just put it over here and now I am in this environment so as you can see it says web UI so we good to go with that we'll just go and install the requirements so I will just put this over here there's a requirements.txt file in this folder which got downloaded when you get cloned it so it's just going to install all the dependencies for this project to work

 so we let that happen and as you can see I have not even looked inside the folder I not even seen the code yet I don't even need to do that that's the power of using browseruse and building AI agents with it so we let that happen and once that is done we'll also just install Play I think it's already installed yeah it's already installed here and now we just have to have this one command python web ui. py and we'll just copy this and paste it right here what this does is it initiates a local host Port through which we can open up our AI agent window 

so now you'll be able to see browser use web UI it'll take a couple of seconds but then we can basically go to https SL this particular address so I'll just copy this and if I paste it over here there you go this is browser used web UI this will help us run any agent that we want to so I'll close the previous windows and this is all that you have to focus on let me just make it bigger oops Yeah so you'll see you have multiple things over here you have first account settings you then have LLM configuration this is where you'll put who is the LLM provider what is the name of the model and the temperature which is basically how creative you want the model to be and then if you are using some API then you can enter this over here then you have  the browser settings which you don't have to mess around with 

then you have the important place which is called run agent this is where you will describe what do you want this agent to really do and once you do that then the agent will do it on your behalf then you have configuration you don't have to worry about this and the results page is where you'll be able to see the recording of what this agent has just done and in the final result it will show the output and there are some errors if there are any to it will show over here then you also have some recordings in this particular instance but what you have to first of all do is to create a llm provider for it so this is the browser use part ofit the next part is picking a llm provider now you have so many of them right you can go to chat GPT you can use this API of chat GPT

 you can go to Gemini and you can use their API key or if you want to do something else then you can always go to chat. deep seek.com and use the API of deep seek let's just search Google AI studio so we'll do that we get Google AI studio right here and let's create a API key right so we don't want to use Gemini we want to get the API of Gemini so let's click on get API key and I'll just say create API key and I'll just use Gemini API it'll take a couple of seconds and now I have an API key generated and I can use this API for completely free you can go on to LM provider and browser use and click on Gemini and over here let's just use the 2.0 flash experimental this is a model that Gemini has launched uh this is a smaller faster model also experimental but we can basically just paste the API key right here and we are good to go !

that's all you need now you can go to the Run agent section and specify a task that you wanted to do very basic thing let's just say go to google.com and search let's just say deep seek and click enter and give me the first five URLs that you get that's it that's all I wanted to do and I'll click on run agent and it will create a window automatically and it will do the things on my behalf look my hands are here and it is doing the thing automatically it's going to go on Google it will analyze the CSS of Google it will find out where is the search bar it will then enter deep seek it will then hit enter and in some time it will fetch the top five links that it sees on Google automatically without me having to do anything this window will close and you just go to the results tab you can go down and you will see the top five links from the search that it did automatically. This is incredible!. Now it might seem very lame but you can do anything that you can think of !

I said go to amazon.in login into my account using email as I entered my email and password as I gave it my password and find a let's say 2 kg detergent and add it to the cart and order it for me using my Amazon pay balance to the address which has I can enter my address I just entered my flat number and I said in the saved addresses \list this is it this is the only prompt I entered and with this what it did was it was able to go let me just grab that video to show it to you it literally just went to Amazon it logged in entered the password searched two 2kg detergent it picked a detergent it then added it to the cart and it then proceeded to check out and I had some balance in my account left and it was able to order that using  the address and just clicked on place your order that's it my oder was placed automatically without me having to do all the things myself this is mindblowing you can ask it to book flights for you you can ask it to book movie tickets for you you can ask it to do anything that you might want to do this agent.
